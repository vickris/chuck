# Chuck
Chuck is a coding test to show some understanding of how to build a backend. It fetches jokes from the Chuck Norris Joke API. 

## Brief
We want you to build an application in Elixir that will: Display a list of jokes from the Chuck Norris API that:

- Allows a user to favourite jokes.
- Allows a user to retrieve their favourite jokes.
- Allows a user to share his favourite jokes with another user.
- The only requirements other than the functionality above are:

All actions should be accessible through HTTP, this does not mean it needs a visual interface, an API is fine too.
You should not use an external database.
The goal of this assignment is to use as a basis for discussion in the technical interview. You should not spend more than 4 hours on this assignment (you are free to do so however).
